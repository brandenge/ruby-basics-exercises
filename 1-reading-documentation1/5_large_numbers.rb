You can add underscores at regular intervals within the number, such as after every 3 digits (just as commas are normally used). So for example, the number 1234567890, which normally would be written as 1,234,567,890, can be written in Ruby using the syntax 1_234_567_890.

Note that the underscores can be placed in the number however you want. Ruby does not care, it is purely for human readability purposes. So the same number can be represented as 12_34_56_789_0.
