    *** 1 - Unpredictable Weather (Part 1) ***

Problem: In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals 'visible'.

Solution:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
puts "The sun is so bright!" if sun == 'visible'

    *** 2 - Unpredictable Weather (Part 2) ***

Problem: In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals 'visible'.

Solution:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
puts "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun == 'visible'

    *** 3 - Unpredictable Weather (Part 3) ***

Problem: In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals visible. Also, write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun equals visible.

When writing these statements, take advantage of Ruby's expressiveness and use statement modifiers instead of an if...end statement to print results only when some condition is met or not met.

Solution:

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
puts "The sun is so bright!" if sun == 'visible'
puts "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun == 'visible'

    *** 4 - True or False ***

Problem: In the code below, boolean is randomly assigned as true or false.

boolean = [true, false].sample

Write a ternary operator that prints "I'm true!" if boolean equals true and prints "I'm false!" if boolean equals false.

Solution:

puts [true, false].sample ? "I'm true!" : "I'm false!"

    *** 5 - Truthy Number ***

Problem: What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

Solution: My favorite number is 7.

    *** 6 - Stoplight (Part 1) ***

Problem: In the code below, stoplight is randomly assigned as 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

Write a case statement that prints "Go!" if stoplight equals 'green', "Slow down!" if stoplight equals 'yellow', and "Stop!" if stoplight equals 'red'.

Solution:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

case ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample
when 'green' then puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow' then puts 'Slow down!'
else puts 'Stop!'
end

    *** 7 - Stoplight (Part 2) ***

Problem: Convert the following case statement to an if statement.

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

Solution:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

puts 'Go!' if stoplight == 'green'
puts 'Slow down!' if stoplight == 'yellow'
puts 'Stop!' if stoplight == 'red'

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

if stoplight == 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
elsif stoplight == 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

    *** 8 - Sleep Alert ***

Problem: In the code below, status is randomly assigned as 'awake' or 'tired'.

status = ['awake', 'tired'].sample

Write an if statement that returns "Be productive!" if status equals 'awake' and returns "Go to sleep!" otherwise. Then, assign the return value of the if statement to a variable and print that variable.

Solution:

status = ['awake', 'tired'].sample

message =
  if status == 'awake'
    "Be productive"
  else
    "Go to sleep!"
  end

puts message

    *** 9 - Cool Numbers ***

Problem: In the code below, number is randomly assigned a number between 0 and 9. Then, an if statement is used to print "5 is a cool number!" or "Other numbers are cool too!" based on the value of number.

number = rand(10)

if number = 5
  puts '5 is a cool number!'
else
  puts 'Other numbers are cool too!'
end

Currently, "5 is a cool number!" is being printed every time the program is run. Fix the code so that "Other numbers are cool too!" gets a chance to be executed.

Solution:

number = rand(10)

if number == 5
  puts '5 is a cool number!'
else
  puts 'Other numbers are cool too!'
end

    *** 10 - Stoplight (Part 3) ***

Problem: Reformat the following case statement so that it only takes up 5 lines.

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'
  puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow'
  puts 'Slow down!'
else
  puts 'Stop!'
end

Solution:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
when 'green'  then puts 'Go!'
when 'yellow' then puts 'Slow down!'
else               puts 'Stop!'
end
